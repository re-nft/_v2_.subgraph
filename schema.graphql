# but not neccesarily an array of renting.
# Renting array is only ever populated if the Nft has been rented.

# 2. Note: that this is a single entity and there will be multiple
# entities. When we make a graphql request, we will be pulling ALL
# such entities

# 3. Also note that when this nftAddress::tokenId::lentAmount unique combo gets
# re-lent by the renter, we push into the lending array. This implies
# that if you have lending.length === renting.length + 1, then the
# nft and tokenId combo are available for lend.
# If, however, lending.length === renting.length, then it is being currently
# rented by someone"
